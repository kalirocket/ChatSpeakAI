## Introduction
### Overview
The ChatSpeakAI project is an open source voice application designed to enable natural language conversations between users and the ChatGPT model. The main goal of ChatSpeakAI is to provide an interactive and user-friendly voice assistant experience by using speech recognition tools, speech synthesis tools and natural language processing techniques.

With ChatSpeakAI, users can communicate with the voice assistant by speaking commands and questions and receive responses in a conversational manner. The application is powered by the ChatGPT model, which allows it to generate relevant and accurate context responses based on user inputs.

In this document specification, details of the application architecture, data models, API integrations, user interface components, dependencies, development guides, testing strategy, deployment process, and future considerations will be detailed. This document serves as a guide for developers and contributors involved in the ChatSpeakAI project.
